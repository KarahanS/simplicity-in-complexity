# Simplicity in Complexity

Code for the paper Simplicity in Complexity https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03134 published at the Cogsci conference 2024.

The following script reproduces results from the paper:

- `/analysis/main.ipynb`: comparison of our model against baselines.

- `/analysis/histograms.ipynb`: visualizing the predictions of our models.

- `/analysis/fail_examples.ipynb`: example outputs and failure cases for our model.

- `/analysis/fail_quantify.ipynb`: quantifying the failure mode on the VISC and Savoias Interior Design imagesets.

The `/baselines` folder contains instructions for running the baseline models reported in Table 1.

The `/sam` and `/fcclip` folders contain instructions for running SAM and FC-CLIP respectively.
